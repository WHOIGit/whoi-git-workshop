# Installing git

## For Mac or Linux

See git's [official installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

## For Windows

There are several ways to install git on Windows. For the workshop, you should install
"Git for Windows". First, [download it](https://git-for-windows.github.io/), and run the installer.

When installing, you will encounter the following screen. Select "checkout as-is, commit unix-style endings":

(FIXME need picture here)

After installing it, you will have an application called Git Bash, which we will be using for the workshop.

During the hands-on, you will be editing files. Instead of using Notepad, you should use an editor that is
more appropriate for code, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (free) or
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (free to try).

There are tools for Windows that provide GUI support for git, such [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/).
The workshop will not cover those tools.
